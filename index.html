                <p class="text-muted text-left">The library is one of my favorite places in the school! I LOVE to read, and there are so many different types of books there. Fiction, non-fiction, novels, comic books, graphic novels, picture books. They even have manga! Sometimes, when classes take visits to the library, they have breakouts! Breakouts are the best! They'll give you a locked box, and some clues, and you need to figure out the combinations to unlock the locks! The media center teaches you many important skills. They have chromebooks, and they teach you how to code with blocks in code.org, and other skills. Once, they even brought out robots, and taught us how to control them!The media center is one of my favorite places. </p>

In the mornings, you can pop by for some breakfast, like muffins and cereal. Don't forget to sign up for lunch so you can get some mouthwatering food! Every friday, there's pizza, but I think the best item on the menu is grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. Delicious! And the best part is, the food is free!
                    <br>
                    But, the cafeteria doubles as an auditorium! When it's time for the talent show, get ready! Us Whales will blow your mind with incredible tricks! Stop by the cafetorium anytime! You'll be welcomed with open arms, and a plate of some food!

Each class gets a different color, and they get to decide their names and costumes. It's up to you to read the most! So, are you ready?</p>

                The Board of Education has decided to postpone the proposed $56 million renovation of Windermere Elementary School for a year. The board was set to hold a town meeting, but it got postponed by COVID-19. With lower enrollment in the short term, the board couldn’t expand Windermere to the size projected in January 2020 and receive full reimbursement from the state. But the board also doesn’t want to make the school too small for future needs. “It’s important that Windermere be renovated,” he said. “It’s just a question of when and of wisely spending taxpayer dollars.” says Dr. Scott Nicol, the superindendent.
